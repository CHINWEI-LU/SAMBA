# SAMBA: A Graph-Mamba Approach for Stock Price Forecasting

This is the official Pytorch implementation of the SAMBA, which is proposed in our paper ["Mamba Meets Finacial Markets: A Graph-Mamba Approach for Stock Price Forecasting"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03707) accepted for publication in *IEEE ICASSP*, 2025.

## Installation

First, check the requirements as follows:\
python\
numpy\
pytorch



Then clone the repository as follows:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Ali-Meh619/SAMBA.git
```

## Description

The file "System Setup and Generating Dataset" contains the code for simulation parameters, creating the system environment and generating the training and test datasets.\
The file "MHGphormer Architecture" contains the code for the MHGphormer learning algorithm.\
The file "Loss Function and Training" contains the code for designing the loss function based on the optimization problem and the training process.\
The file "Execution" contains the code for running the model in the training and test phases.
